      <p><strong>Extension Explanation:</strong>  
      I extended the trivia machine by connecting it to a Taylor Swift lyrics API. I made it display a lyric, the song title, and the album it’s from. I also made the background color change based on the album that the lyrics are from. I also added a loading message that the lyrics are being fetched. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Imagining API Use in My Critique Project:</strong>  
      I could use an API in my project to pull in actual job postings from public job boards. Using an API would make the project more dynamic and data-driven, allowing for unique and personalized interactions.</p>
